        <p> My Name is Santosh Malaki and I currently work in the Harm Reduction Program
            at the Baltimore County Department of Health. I am Spanish Interpreter as well. Currently, I am in a transition phase from
            working in Public Health, to working in tech, web development and computer programming. This program is teaching
            me to be someone who learns all the time, and I am grateful to be in it.

            I enjoy Yoga, Meditation, Breathwork, walking, swimming, and also resistance bands exercises to keep healthy. I also enjoy travel, culture, meeting people, and learning new langauges.
